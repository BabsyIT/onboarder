Our portfolio of great and competent supervisors is as diverse as the situations are. We recommend sitters to build a portfolio of several families so that you have one or two main families and a few in backup - this way, care is guaranteed at all times. Sitters can get to know the family in advance at any time, if there is enough time to book, we also recommend this. Be it in person or on the virtual path. And should it not be enough, sitters can trust it: Not only the Babsy crew put the families through their paces, but mostly many other Babsy sitters too :) we hope that this will be a little more effective Creates security, should it not be enough to get to know the family beforehand." }

We have around 3 \"categories\" of sitters, depending on your needs, a Saturday evening hobby sitter is completely different from the one who takes care of the child when it is sick. Our portfolio of great and competent supervisors is as diverse as the situations are. We recommend parents to build a portfolio of several sitters so that you have one or two main sitters and a few in backup - this way, care is guaranteed at all times. Parents can get to know the sitter in advance at any time, if there is enough time to book, we also recommend this. Be it in person or on the virtual path. And should it not be enough, parents can trust it: Not only the Babsy crew put the sitters through their paces, but mostly many other Babsy parents too :) we hope that this will be a little more effective Creates security, should it not be enough to get to know the sitter beforehand." }
