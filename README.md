## Important

The heart of the application is the calendar booking system.
SuperBabsys have availabilities which determine if they are shown to the potential sitter or parent.
If forward looking time window of the booking intesects with an availability of a SuperBabsy the SuperBabsy can be shown to the user.

The second important part is the compentencies options (Language per users type: English for Sitters), which need to intersect with the SuperBabsys compentencies.
